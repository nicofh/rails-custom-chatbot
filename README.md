Rails Api Base is a boilerplate project for JSON RESTful APIs. It follows the community best practices in terms of standards, security and maintainability, integrating a variety of testing and code quality tools. It's based on Rails 7.0 and Ruby 3.1.

Finally, it contains a plug an play Administration console (thanks to [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin)).

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
1. Install PostgreSQL in case you don't have it
1. Run `bootstrap.sh` with the name of your project like `./bootstrap.sh --name=my_awesome_project`
1. `rspec` and make sure all tests pass
1. `rails s`
1. You can now try your REST services!

## How to use with docker

1. Have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed (You can check this by doing `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`)
1. Run `bootstrap.sh` with the name of your project and the `-d` or `--for-docker` flag like `./bootstrap.sh --name=my_awesome_project -d`
    1. Run `./bootstrap.sh --help` for the full details.
1. Generate a secret key for the app by running `bin/web rake secret`, copy it and add it in your environment variables.
1. (Optional) If you want to deny access to the database from outside of the `docker-compose` network, remove the `ports` key in the `docker-compose.yml` from the `db` service.
1. (Optional) Run the tests to make sure everything is working with: `bin/rspec .`.
1. You can now try your REST services!

## Dev scripts
This template provides a handful of scripts to make your dev experience better!

- bin/bundle to run any `bundle` commands.
  - `bin/bundle install`
- bin/rails to run any `rails` commands
  - `bin/rails console`
- bin/web to run any `bash` commands
  - `bin/web ls`
- bin/rspec to run specs
  - `bin/rspec .`

You don't have to use these but they are designed to run the same when running with docker or not.
To illustrate, `bin/rails console` will run the console in the docker container when running with docker and locally when not.

- [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) Run `brakeman -I` to generate `config/brakeman.ignore`

## Configuring Code Climate
1. After adding the project to CC, go to `Repo Settings`
1. On the `Test Coverage` tab, copy the `Test Reporter ID`
1. Set the current value of `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` in the [circle-ci project env variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project)

## Code Owners

You can use [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners) file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in the repository.
